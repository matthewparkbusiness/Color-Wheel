# Color-Wheel
Color Wheel v1.0

This game allows for a user to rotate a color wheel to collect converging dots and earn points. These dots can only be collected if they match the color on the color wheel which is divided into 3 colors (see previews below for an illustration). The difficulty can be increased through a settings menu from the home screen, which increases the rate of dots as well as including a special kind of dot that requires any other color than itself. This game is open for contributions and critiques.
